    <h1>Serving Fonts to Web Clients</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Using Web Font Hosting Services</h2>
    <p>
        One of the easiest methods to serve fonts is by using web font hosting services like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. 
        These platforms allow you to choose a font and provide a link or import statement to include in your HTML or CSS. 
        Once included, you can then set that font for any HTML element using CSS.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Self-hosting fonts</h2>
    <p>
        Another method is self-hosting, where you host the font files on your own server or project directory. 
        By using the <code>@font-face</code> rule in CSS, you specify the path to the font file and then apply the font using the specified font family name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both methods have their pros and cons. Using a web font hosting service is straightforward and offers a wide variety of fonts, while self-hosting gives you more control and can be used when dealing with custom fonts.
